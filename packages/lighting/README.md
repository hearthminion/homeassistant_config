# Lights Package

## Description

## Installation
### Home Assistant Custom Integrations
#### [Adaptive Lighting](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting)
Author: basnijholt

The adaptive_lighting platform changes the settings of your lights throughout the day. It uses the position of the sun to calculate the color temperature and brightness that is most fitting for that time of the day. Scientific research has shown that this helps to maintain your natural circadian rhythm (your biological clock) and might lead to improved sleep, mood, and general well-being.
